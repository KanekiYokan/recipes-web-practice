    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is made with guanciale (cured pork), eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, spaghetti pasta, and lots of black
        pepper. Italians don't add extra ingredients like cream, milk, garlic, or onions. Try this recipe if you want to
        make an authentic, creamy carbonara that comes straight from Italy, where I live. Buon appetito!</p>
    <p>Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its signature rich and silky sauce comes
        from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta. The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot enough to
        cook the eggs, but not so hot that they curdle.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> This traditional Italian recipe starts with olive oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Guanciale:</strong> Buy guanciale (or cured pork cheek) at your local butcher. If you can't find it,
            you can substitute unsmoked bacon or pancetta.</li>
        <li><strong>Spaghetti:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade spaghetti noodles. If you like, you can substitute
            bucatini for the spaghetti.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Three large eggs add richness and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Opt for hand-shredded Pecorino Romano cheese. You can substitute Parmesan, if
            preferred.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This flavorful spaghetti alla carbonara is simply seasoned with salt and
            pepper.</li>
    </ul>
